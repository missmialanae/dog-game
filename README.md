# The Dog Game (Place Holder Title)
A very shitty but simple game of a dog that is not 100% yet but I am working on it 

This is my very first game and it is very basic and simple. It is inspired by Space Invaders and is basically just a dog dodging fallen object. Nothing to wild. I am using python with the turtle import. At the moment I am still on the basic stages. Up next I should be working on making the enemy objects which will be located in the enemy branch
